## Noir's Purpose
 After years in the coding trenches, surrounded by a sea of color themes, I found myself lost in the hunt for the perfect one. It hit me like a plot twist in a noir thriller: all those colors were just a distraction, masking the true essence of the code. That's when the desire for a black and white theme, a theme that cuts through the smoke and mirrors, took root. But my search yielded nothing but empty leads. So, I took matters into my own hands, crafting a new theme with black and white as its foundation, like the stark contrast between light and shadow in a gritty detective story, and injecting color only where it truly matters. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîçüé¨
